# WebGUI for YarraServer

This repository contains the source code for the web interface for the YarraServer, which is part of the Yarra framework. The Yarra WebGUI has been developed using the Wt framework (http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt). The current version used is 3.3.4. Please refer to the installation instructions provided on the Wt homepage. For running the compiler, it is recommended to use Qt creator (http://qt-project.org/). Compiling the code requires GCC 4.8 and Boost 1.54. When compiling under Ubuntu 12.04 it is necessary to update the GCC compiler for 4.8 and compile Boost from the source code using the newer GCC version.
